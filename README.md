### Overview

This project is part of consultancy work I undertook for a Middle Eastern country. The name of the country remains undisclosed. It demonstrates how to conduct macro and sectoral overviews, with a more detailed analysis focusing on a specific sector. This section illustrates a simple approach for transitioning from sample data to the population and formulating general conclusions applicable to the broader population.

### Content
